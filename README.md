# Learning Management System for Teachers
## Short Description:  
The planned system will integrate with “Revoducate”, a personalized learning platform that tailors learning tracks to students based on their skills and profiles. Currently, the system collects and displays student performance data for teachers (referred to as “Learning Managers”). However, the diverse range of result types makes it difficult for teachers to effectively track progress, analyze data, and optimize learning processes.
To address this challenge, we aim to develop an assistant tool to help teachers track and manage learning progress in their classes. The system will integrate with "Revoducate"' and leverage Machine Learning (ML), Data analytics, and Business Intelligence (BI) techniques. It will analyze and visualize data on the scope of individual students and class levels, providing insights, predictions and recommendations. 
## Key features include:
Statistical Analysis: Detecting anomalies in performance.
Machine Learning: Recognizing patterns, predicting outcomes, and offering context-aware recommendations to support informed decision-making and process optimization.
An example of a possible analysis in our system: Comparing students' progress against peers and the study plan, identifying students who are excelling or struggling, and suggesting tailored adjustments to enhance learning outcomes.

## Execution Method:
The project will be executed in Agile methodology. We split the work into 3 main phases: planning, execution and summary. We will have 14 iterations in total. The first iteration (planning phase) will take approximately 3 weeks, and the last iteration (summary phase) will take approximately 2 weeks. The other 12 iterations (in execution phase) will take approximately 3 weeks each and include: planning, development, and review phases to ensure continuous feedback and adaptability. This iterative approach will help align the final product with project goals and user needs.
